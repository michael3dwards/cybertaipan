# Checklist for Cyber-Taipan Competition

## Notes

When going through the README file on the image, think about all the tasks that could exist for each sentence.

Jot them down and at the end, assign a amount of time to each task, then group into hours so at each hour if you are stuck move onto the next hours' tasks.

Most things can be done from the Terminal (press the Windows key, and search for Terminal to open it), and you should be able to find a command to do what you need.

**If you don't understand a word or term, Google it. Also, if you are unsure how to do something Google `'ubuntu [version] [thing you want to do]'`.**
